# Rust Engineering Practices — Beyond `cargo build`


## Speaker Intro

- Principal Firmware Architect in Microsoft SCHIE (Silicon and Cloud Hardware Infrastructure Engineering) team
- Industry veteran with expertise in security, systems programming (firmware, operating systems, hypervisors), CPU and platform architecture, and C++ systems
- Started programming in Rust in 2017 (@AWS EC2), and have been in love with the language ever since

---

> A practical guide to the Rust toolchain features that most teams discover too late:
> build scripts, cross-compilation, benchmarking, code coverage, and safety verification
> with Miri and Valgrind. Each chapter uses concrete examples drawn from
> a real hardware-diagnostics codebase —
> a large multi-crate workspace — so every technique maps directly to production code.

## How to Use This Book

This book is designed for **self-paced study or team workshops**. Each chapter is largely independent — read them in order or jump to the topic you need.

### Difficulty Legend

| Symbol | Level | Meaning |
|:------:|-------|---------|
| 🟢 | Starter | Straightforward tools with clear patterns — useful on day one |
| 🟡 | Intermediate | Requires understanding of toolchain internals or platform concepts |
| 🔴 | Advanced | Deep toolchain knowledge, nightly features, or multi-tool orchestration |

### Pacing Guide

| Part | Chapters | Est. Time | Key Outcome |
|------|----------|:---------:|-------------|
| **I — Build & Ship** | ch01–02 | 3–4 h | Build metadata, cross-compilation, static binaries |
| **II — Measure & Verify** | ch03–05 | 4–5 h | Statistical benchmarking, coverage gates, Miri/sanitizers |
| **III — Harden & Optimize** | ch06–10 | 6–8 h | Supply chain security, release profiles, compile-time tools, `no_std`, Windows |
| **IV — Integrate** | ch11–13 | 3–4 h | Production CI/CD pipeline, tricks, capstone exercise |
| | | **16–21 h** | **Full production engineering pipeline** |

### Working Through Exercises

Each chapter contains **🏋️ exercises** with difficulty indicators. Solutions are provided in expandable `<details>` blocks — try the exercise first, then check your work.

- 🟢 exercises can often be done in 10–15 minutes
- 🟡 exercises require 20–40 minutes and may involve running tools locally
- 🔴 exercises require significant setup and experimentation (1+ hour)

**Read in any order**: ch01, ch03, ch04, ch05, ch06, ch09 are independent.
**Read after prerequisites**: ch02 (needs ch01), ch07–ch08 (benefit from ch03–ch06), ch10 (benefits from ch09).
**Read last**: ch11 (ties everything together), ch12 (tricks), ch13 (reference).
